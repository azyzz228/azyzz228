Hi 👋 My name is Aziz Abdullaev
===============================

I am a senior student currently at Duke studying EnvSci/PubPol. Why the heck do I have a GitHub profile? I learned a bit of web dev and got involved in hackathons coincidentally. The rest is hitory, as they say it. I went on winning 6 hackathons with my wonderful team and was named MLH Top 50 2022 ([here](https://top.mlh.io/2022/profiles/aziz-abdullaev) is my story). Coding/developing/creating became my **main** interest, and that's what I am doing now. I took Data Structure and Algorithms class, now taking Computer Systems class at Duke. There are others things I do apart from classes, though.
