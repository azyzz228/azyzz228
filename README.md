Hi üëã My name is aziz
=============================== 

*   üöÄ  I was a Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellow Fall 22', Open Source track. I worked under supervision of [Jordan Harband](https://github.com/ljharb) and contributed to [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import) which has 16M weekly downloads. I tried to fix the bugs that were raised, improve performance, enhance existing rules, refactor code, and contribute to the discussion on created issues.
*   üèÜ  I have 'won' 7+ hackathons, for which I was selected as [MLH's Top 50](https://top.mlh.io/2022/profiles/aziz-abdullaev). Check out my [devpost to see the project I have built with my awesome team.](https://devpost.com/azyzz228).
